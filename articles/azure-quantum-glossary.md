# Azure Quantum glossary

## Adjoint

The complex conjugate transpose of an [operation](xref:microsoft.quantum.glossary-qdk#operation). For operations that implement a [unitary](xref:microsoft.quantum.glossary-qdk#unitary-operator) operator, the adjoint is the inverse of the operation and is indicated by a dagger symbol. For example, if the operation `U` represents the unitary operator $U$, then `Adjoint U` represents $U^\dagger$. For more information, see [Functor application](xref:microsoft.quantum.qsharp.functorapplication#functor-application).

## Auxiliary qubit

## Floquet codes

Floquet codes are a new class of error correction codes that respond to noise and errors dynamically, as compared to traditional correction codes that protect against static errors.

## Function

A type of subroutine in the Q# language that is purely deterministic. While functions are used within quantum algorithms, they cannot act on [qubits](xref:microsoft.quantum.glossary-qdk#qubit) or call [operations](xref:microsoft.quantum.glossary-qdk#operation). 
For more information, see [The Q# user guide](xref:microsoft.quantum.user-guide-qdk.overview)

## Gate

A [quantum circuit](xref:microsoft.quantum.glossary-qdk#quantum-circuit-diagram) is a network of gates, based on the similar concept of classical logic circuits.

## Global phase

When two [states](xref:microsoft.quantum.glossary-qdk#quantum-state) are identical up to a multiple of a complex number $e^{i\phi}$, they are said to differ up to a global phase. Unlike local phases, global phases cannot be observed through any [measurement](xref:microsoft.quantum.glossary-qdk#measurement). For more information, see [The Qubit](xref:microsoft.quantum.concepts.qubit).

## Hadamard

The Hadamard operation (also referred to as the Hadamard gate or transform) acts on a single [qubit](xref:microsoft.quantum.glossary-qdk#qubit) and puts it in an even [superposition](xref:microsoft.quantum.glossary-qdk#superposition) of $\ket{0}$ or $\ket{1}$ if the qubit is initially in the $\ket{0}$ state. In Q#, this operation is applied by the pre-defined [`H`](xref:Microsoft.Quantum.Intrinsic.H) operation.

Models of hybrid quantum computing are [batch hybrid](#batch-hybrid-quantum-computing), [iterative hybrid](#iterative-hybrid-quantum-computing), [integrated hybrid](#integrated-hybrid-quantum-computing), and [distributed hybrid](#distributed-hybrid-quantum-computing). For more information, see [Introduction to hybrid quantum computing](xref:microsoft.quantum.overview.hybrid).

## Immutable

A variable whose value cannot be changed. An immutable variable in Q# is created using the `let` keyword. To declare variables that *can* be changed, use the [mutable](xref:microsoft.quantum.glossary-qdk#immutable) keyword to declare and the `set` keyword to modify the value. 

## Iterative hybrid quantum computing

A model of [hybrid quantum computing](#hybrid-quantum-computing) where the classical compute resides in the cloud, resulting in lower latency and repeated execution of a quantum circuit with different parameters. Quantum jobs can be grouped in [sessions](#sessions), allowing for longer runs and prioritized access to quantum hardware. 

## Integrated hybrid quantum computing

A model of [hybrid quantum computing](#hybrid-quantum-computing) where the classical and quantum processors are physically close, allowing classical computations to be performed while physical qubits are coherent. Integrated hybrid makes use of [mid-circuit measurement](#mid-circuit-measurement) and [qubit reuse](#qubit-reuse). 

## Job

## Mid-circuit measurement

The process of performing quantum state measurements at various points during the execution of the program, rather than only at the end. This allows for making decisions by the classical program about the circuit flow. Closely related to [Qubit reuse](#qubit-reuse).

## Mutable

A variable whose value may be changed after it is created. A mutable variable in Q# is declared using the `mutable` keyword and modified using the `set` keyword. Variables created with the `let` keyword are [immutable](xref:microsoft.quantum.glossary-qdk#immutable) and their value cannot be changed.

## Namespace

A label for a collection of related names (for example, [operations](xref:microsoft.quantum.glossary-qdk#operation), [functions](xref:microsoft.quantum.glossary-qdk#function), and [user-defined types](xref:microsoft.quantum.glossary-qdk#user-defined-type)). For instance the namespace [Microsoft.Quantum.Preparation](xref:Microsoft.Quantum.Preparation) labels all of the symbols defined in the standard library that help with preparing initial states.

## Operation

Typically, the goal is to provide a [superposition](xref:microsoft.quantum.glossary-qdk#superposition) of outputs corresponding to inputs that are in superposition. For more information, see [Oracles](xref:microsoft.quantum.libraries.overview.data-structures#oracles).

## Partial application

Calling a [function](xref:microsoft.quantum.glossary-qdk#function) or [operation](xref:microsoft.quantum.glossary-qdk#operation) without all the required inputs. This returns a new [callable](xref:microsoft.quantum.glossary-qdk#callable) that only needs the missing parameters (indicated by an underscore) to be supplied during a future application. For more information, see [Partial application](xref:microsoft.quantum.qsharp.closures#partial-application).

## Pauli operators

A set of three 2 x 2 unitary matrices known as the `X`, `Y` and `Z` quantum operations. The identity matrix, $I$, is often included in the set as well.  $I = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$, $X = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$, $Y = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}$, $Z = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}$.

## Qubit

A basic unit of quantum information, analogous to a *bit* in classical computing. For more information, see [The Qubit](xref:microsoft.quantum.concepts.qubit).

## Qubit reuse

Related to [Mid-circuit measurement](#measurement), qubit reuse is the practice of designing circuits to use the same qubit multiple times in a quantum computation to minimize the total qubits needed to run your program. After a mid-circuit measurement, a qubit can be reset and reused, allowing you to run more complex computations on hardware with fewer qubits.  

## Repeat-until-success

A concept often used in quantum algorithms that consists of repeatedly applying a computation until a certain condition is satisfied. When the condition is not satisfied, often a fixup is required before retrying by entering the next iteration. For more information, see the [Q# user guide](xref:microsoft.quantum.user-guide-qdk.overview)

For more information, see [Quantum circuits](xref:microsoft.quantum.concepts.circuits) and the respective kata at [Quantum Katas](xref:microsoft.quantum.tutorial-qdk.katas).

## Tuple

A collection of comma-separated values that acts as a single value. The *type* of a tuple is defined by the types of values it contains. In Q#, tuples are [immutable](xref:microsoft.quantum.glossary-qdk#immutable) and can be nested, contain arrays, or used in an array. For more information, see [Tuples](xref:microsoft.quantum.qsharp.valueliterals#tuple-literals).
